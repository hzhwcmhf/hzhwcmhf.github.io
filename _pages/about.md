Experience
======

- **2021.3 - 2022.5**: NLP Research Intern at ByteDance AI Lab

	* Aim at developing new paradigms for language generation, mainly focusing on **non-autoregressive generators**.
	* Theoretically analyze the learning of non-autoregressive generators. ([Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05975))
	* Empirically improve the generation quality of non-autoregressive generators, first showing that a non-autoregressive generator can *outperform the vanilla Transformer in quality and achieve 7~14 times speedup in decoding*. ([Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07459))
	* Provide an open-source framework for highly efficient training and inference, including operations implemented in *Cuda and multi-threaded C++*. ([Code Link](https://github.com/thu-coai/DA-Transformer))
	* **Two paper published and one patent pending**.

- **2018.11 - 2020.8** : Leader of Open-Source Toolkit Development for Text Generation
  - CoTK toolkit: An open-source python library for fast development and fair evaluation of text generation. ([Github Link](https://github.com/thu-coai/cotk), 121 stars.)
  - It provides unified APIs for different datasets, a signature mechanism to avoid unfair comparisons in evaluation, and implementations for text generation models.
  - I act as a leader in this project and work with 5 other students of the CoAI group. I design and implement the main framework of the toolkit. 

- **2016.4 - 2016.8**: Exchange Student at Tokyo University, Japan

	* I studied at the department of information science and took courses mainly about machine learning.
	* Fully sponsored by China Scholarship Council.
